# Little Brother by CoryDoctorow

## **Purpose**

The purpose of this archive is to present Cory Doctorow's amazing novel **Little Brother** in Markdown format.  I decided on the Markdown format because its formatting is simple and it can easily be converted to a number of different formats.  Also, github will automatically display Markdown files in the proper layout.  This makes it easy for anyone who wants to read it online, or clone the archive and make their own copy.

Also, check out the author's website where you can find other versions of the book (epub, mobi, ect), buy a physical copy, or make a donation [craphound.com](http://craphound.com/littlebrother/about/).

## **Summary**

From the author's website:
Marcus, a.k.a “w1n5t0n”, is only seventeen years old, but he figures he already knows how the system works–and how to work the system. Smart, fast, and wise to the ways of the networked world, he has no trouble outwitting his high school’s intrusive but clumsy surveillance systems.

But his whole world changes when he and his friends find themselves caught in the aftermath of a major terrorist attack on San Francisco. In the wrong place at the wrong time, Marcus and his crew are apprehended by the Department of Homeland Security and whisked away to a secret prison where they’re mercilessly interrogated for days.

When the DHS finally releases them, Marcus discovers that his city has become a police state where every citizen is treated like a potential terrorist. He knows that no one will believe his story, which leaves him only one option: to take down the DHS himself.
